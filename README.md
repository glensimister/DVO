<h1>DVO</h1>

<p>What is DVO?</p>
<p>DVO is a browser extension which serves as a universal API for governance applications. It is similar to MetaMask in that it acts as a bridge between various extensions and applications, and the underlying technologies, such as GunDB, Solid, Etherum, and so on.</p>

<p>The toolbar allows users to like, dislike and comment on any URL.</p>

<p>The screenshot below uses the DVO API extension and the Toolbar extension (see above)</p>

<p>DVO will provide the API for Devolution - a decentralized governance model (screenshot below)</p>
